# Speech To Text

The first part of Subtitled Video Chat will be experimenting with various Speech to Text libraries. My first approach will be to use the (https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition "SpeechToText") python client and experiment with the various backend libraries supported. This page will be kept up to date with developments as I learn more about Speech to Text conventions.
